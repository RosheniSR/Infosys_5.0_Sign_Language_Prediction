# Sign Language Recognition App

The Sign Language Recognition App is a groundbreaking tool aimed at promoting inclusivity and accessibility in communication. By leveraging cutting-edge machine learning technology, this app interprets sign language gestures and converts them into readable text, bridging the communication gap between individuals with hearing or speech impairments and those unfamiliar with sign language.

## Vision
We envision a world where everyone, regardless of physical ability, can communicate freely and effectively. This project aims to foster an inclusive society by empowering individuals and providing essential communication tools for all.

## Mission
Our mission is to develop intuitive, high-quality solutions that simplify everyday interactions for individuals with communication challenges. Through the power of machine learning, the Sign Language Recognition App accurately translates the nuances of sign language into text.

## Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Uses advanced computer vision and machine learning to interpret sign language gestures.
- **Text Conversion**: Converts recognized gestures into readable text, making it accessible for those who don’t know sign language.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, simple UI designed for seamless interactions.
- **Multi-Class Recognition**: Currently supports recognition for a growing dataset with multiple sign language classes.
- **Future Plans**: Expansion to support more languages and gestures, plus enhanced real-time performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For backend programming and machine learning model training.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and gesture recognition.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used to build and train the machine learning model.
- **MediaPipe**: To detect hand landmarks and extract key features.
- **Flask/Django** (optional): For deploying the app as a web service.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains training, testing, and validation datasets.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for exploratory data analysis and initial prototyping.
- `src/`: Contains main code files for the application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Sign-Language-Recognition-App.git


### Dataset
Our app currently uses the WSAL (World Sign Language) dataset. Place the dataset files in the `data/` directory, structured as follows:

```
data/
├── train/
├── test/
└── validation/
```

### Training the Model
To train the model on the dataset, run:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```

### Running the App
1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the app.
